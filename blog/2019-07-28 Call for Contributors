Building the developer community together!

Be a contributor, building the developer community together.

I have been got feedback from the first day I started Rust in Blockchain newsletter. The more I talked to developers, the more pressure I can feel that I couldn't do more for the potential community on my own. The newsletter focuses on long term blockchain engineering, not only updating information for the audience but also eager to create more useful projects and valuable connections. I believe great minds are alike; I also believe talents are gathered from the newsletter can always deliver lasting value for the blockchain industry. We are still at the very early stage in blockchain engineering, and we are the most important ones who build the future.

Well, you don't need to be very professional to join us, you can join us and perfect yourself on the way of contribution. You might be a developer, and you might be an editor or designer, or skilled at some other things. There are too many exciting and interesting problems that need to be solved, we can either build applications, tools, protocols or ariticles, toturials, documentations, and so on. Never worry about what to do next. 

We will collaborate on GitHub for sure, and discuss or brainstorming in Telegram group. We may have asynchronous discussions as well as r synchronous meetings for rapidly solving problems; we may also need a weekly meeting for discussion about what the next important thing to do.
We will meet with timezone problems or enjoy timezone advantages. Who knows how brilliant we will be to find the best solution?

I couldn't image I have got so many supports from people from Germany, Italy, England, the US, and China. If we don't start now, when?
