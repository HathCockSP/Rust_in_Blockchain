**#4 - Sep 2019**

Welcome to the fourth edition of Rust in Blockchain, the hypest newsletter about the hypest combination of technologies. [Previous #3](https://rustinblockchain.org/2019/09/05/rust-in-blockchain-3-august-2019/).

This month, ... TODO.

In the world of Parity, [Signer], the smartphone hardware wallet, [entered 3.0 beta][parity-signer]. Parity Substrate, the toolkit for building blockchains in Rust, now [supports proof of work consensus][substrate-3473], in addition to proof of stake.
