#### Projects

- [arkworks::algebra](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/algebra).
  The arkworks ecosystem consist of Rust libraries for designing
  and working with zero knowledge succinct non-interactive
  arguments (zkSNARKs). This repository contains efficient
  implementations some of the key algebraic components
  underlying zkSNARKs: finite fields, elliptic curves,
  and polynomials.
  This [organization](https://github.com/arkworks-rs)
  looks cool: An ecosystem for developing and programming with zkSNARKs.	
- [t3rn](https://github.com/t3rn/t3rn).
  A protocol for interoperable code execution between
  multiple blockchains, which makes it safe and simple.
- [Kulupu](https://github.com/kulupu/kulupu).
  Kulupu is a pure (no pre-mine, no gadget) proof-of-work blockchain
  built on the Substrate framework, with support of on-chain
  governance and online upgrades. It uses ASIC-resistant mining algorithm of RandomX.
