- [Introducing the `k256` crate: a pure Rust secp256k1 library based on projective formulas](https://iqlusion.blog/k256-crate-pure-rust-projective-secp256k1-library)

#### Papers 

#### Projects

- [arkworks::algebra](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/algebra).
  The arkworks ecosystem consist of Rust libraries for designing
  and working with zero knowledge succinct non-interactive
  arguments (zkSNARKs). This repository contains efficient
  implementations some of the key algebraic components
  underlying zkSNARKs: finite fields, elliptic curves,
  and polynomials.
  This [organization](https://github.com/arkworks-rs)
  looks cool: An ecosystem for developing and programming with zkSNARKs.	
- [t3rn](https://github.com/t3rn/t3rn).
  A protocol for interoperable code execution between
  multiple blockchains, which makes it safe and simple.
