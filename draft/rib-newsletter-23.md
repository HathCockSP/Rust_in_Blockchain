Welcome to the #23 edition of Rust in Blockchain,
the chillest newsletter about the chillest tech.
[Previous: #22](/newsletters/_TODO_/).

## Thanks

Thanks to contributors:

_TODO_

Thank you for your help!

RiB needs help to keep up with Rust blockchain projects. 
If you follow a particular project, or otherwise find information 
that is beneficial to the Rust & blockchain community, 
please contribute to the next issue
by submitting a PR to the [#24 draft](https://github.com/rust-in-blockchain/Rust-in-Blockchain/tree/master/draft).

## Project Spotlight

Each month we like to shine a light on a notable Rust blockchain project. This month that project is…

*(Comment to editors - I'm just proposing us as a potential spotlight project, and would be humbled to even get a short mention here - we are a community run project full of volunteers from across the world - true decentralizaton!)*

[MASQ](https://github.com/MASQ-Project/Node)

[MASQ](https://masq.ai) is a unique software that combines the benefits of VPN and Tor technology, to create a superior next-generation privacy software where users are rewarded for supporting an uncensored, global web.
**Users gain privacy and anonymity online, while helping promote Internet Freedom**

Rust was chosen for the codebase to leverage several key strengths of the programming langauge:
  1. MASQ dev team wanted the code close to the processor & OS - not separated by a virtual machine like you get with java/Ruby/JavaScript. (therefore not dependant on the presence of any third-party software possibly not available to some of folks who want to run MASQ Node)

  2. Rust was much safer than any of its competitors. Safer, by a considerable margin than Java. (With Java, for example, you can still have dereferencing crashes and thread races; but you can't in Rust.)

  3. MASQ methodology was heavy on test-driven development, and Rust was written from the very beginning to be test-driveable, rather than having automated tests added as a new thing after it had already matured.

A lot of documentation is available on the GitHub but there is also a [Knowledge Base](https://docs.masq.ao/knowledge) where there are more general concepts explained and an FAQ.
