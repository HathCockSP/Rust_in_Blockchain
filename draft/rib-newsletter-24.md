## Project Spotlight

Each month we like to shine a light on a notable Rust blockchain project. This month that project is…

[TDN] (and [Chamomile]).

Trusted Distributed Network is a framework for building distributed applications,
with support for p2p communications, multiple cross-communicating blockchains,
multiple layers of blockchains, and multiple account models.
It is built on a new p2p library, Chamomile.

TDN appears to be somewhat comparable to Substrate,
and Chamomile to libp2p.

Chamomile adds to the choices available to Rust developers
for p2p networking, which already include [rust-libp2p], and [tentacle].

These projects are authored by

[Awesome Rust Blockchain][arb]
