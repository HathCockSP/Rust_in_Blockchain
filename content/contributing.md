[Rust in Blockchain](https://rustinblockchain.org) is a developer community
that focuses on Rust engineering and adoption in the blockchain industry.
The [RiB Newsletter](/newsletters) is a monthly newsletter that publishes on
the first Wednesday of each month (**Pacific time**).

There are several ways to contribute to the Rust in Blockchain community.
